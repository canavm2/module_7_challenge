The module 7 challenge for fintech course

The Jupyter Lab file follows along to create, update and work with SQL databases by importing them as Pandas Datframes. The worksheet can be launched as a webapplication with Voila

## Technologies

The sheet requires Pandas for analyzing data frames in jupyter labs.
It requires Jupyter Labs for a user interface.
It requires Path from pathlib to help read .csv files.
Requires hvplot, SQLAlchemy, and Voila.

## Installation Guide

Jupyter Labs runs in a browser, including Chrome.  Launch the file by navigating to the directory of the file through a CLI and then running Jupyter labs, with "jupyter lab".

hvplot and geoviews can be installed form the CLI with the following:
